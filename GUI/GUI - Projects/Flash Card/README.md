# **Flash Card**
This directory holds:
- main.py file for the project.
- The csv file for the words that are used.
- A number of images the project needs to function.

The flash card project is a python script, which utilizes tkinter for its GUI and it simulates a flash card for learning a language, now the default langugae to learn with it is Spanish, but you can just adjust the csv file with French or any other words and their translations, and it should still work.
